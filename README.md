# WeatherWise: Real-time Weather App

WeatherWise is an intuitive and responsive web application that provides real-time weather conditions and forecasts. Users can check the current weather for their location or search for weather information in any city worldwide. This project highlights my ability to integrate external APIs and create user-friendly interfaces.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/zaqian01/My-Weather-App.git](https://github.com/zaqian01/My-Weather-App.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd My-Weather-App
    ```
3.  **Get an API Key:**
    * You will need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and obtain your API key.
4.  **Configure API Key:**
    * Open `script.js` (or your main JavaScript file) and locate where the API key is used. Replace the placeholder with your actual API key.
    * *Self-note:* For production, consider using environment variables to hide your API key. For this simple front-end project, directly in JS is often done for local demos.
5.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by dragging it into a browser window.
